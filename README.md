# h12-sim Assets


## 📦 Overview
This repository contains the tool assets for my h12-sim project, based off of Unitree's Isaac Lab implementation of the H1-2. My h12-sim project is an extension of this [article](https://medium.com/correll-lab/grasp-prediction-with-vision-language-models-and-open-vocabulary-object-detection-models-05ea20a6e20c)

## 🧩 Usage
You probably don't want to directly clone this page. Follow the documentation on the main project page.To use these assets within `h12-sim`, clone this repository alongside the main project.

## 🎬 Testing Assets with USDView
I recommend testing assets with Pixar's USDView before trying to get them in Isaac Sim.

'''bash
sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-image0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-keysyms1

#Now, just follow the instructions [here](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/latest/usdview/quickstart.html)

#Run when you are ready
